									<h2>About Mercedas-Benz</h2>
									<p>

Ola Källenius is Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz AG. The company focuses on the development, production and sales of passenger cars, vans and services. Furthermore, the company aspires to be leading in the fields of connectivity, autonomous driving and alternative drives with its forward-looking innovations.

											Mercedes-Benz AG is one of the largest manufacturers of premium passenger cars. In 2018, it sold more than 2.3 million cars and over 420,000 vans. In its two business divisions, Mercedes-Benz AG is continually expanding its worldwide production network with over 40 production sites on four continents, while aligning itself to meet the requirements of electric mobility. At the same time, the company is developing its global battery production network on three continents. Sustainable actions play a decisive role in both business divisions.

										<h2>The all-new Mercedes C-Class sheds more camo and reveals its next-gen S-Class inspired design. The new Mercedes C-Class (W206) is expected on the market in early 2021.</h2>
										<p>In order to remain in the race for the supremacy of sales in the premium segment, the Stuttgart builder is already preparing the next generation of C-Class. In the last months several prototypes have been caught during the test sessions on public roads. Admittedly, the camouflage is still very heavy, but we can now undeniably see the future W206, the car that will replace the current C-Class, getting the same shaped headlights, grille and tail-lights as the future S-Class, expected this year.

											For the interior, the Germans will come with an updated version of the MBUX system and an incredibly large central touchscreen. The diagonal is still unknown, but judging by these spy pics, we’d say at least 15 to 16-inch is a strong possibility. Slightly tilted and angled towards the driver, it is placed much lower than the current model’s display. Below the display we see the controls for the climate control plus a full row of buttons with touch functions, controlling the driving modes, hazard lights, volume, on/off and so on. A closer look reveals that the display in the lower part seamlessly connects to a switch panel that allows the driver and front passenger to operate the climate functions.</p>
									</header>
									<h2>C-class 2021</h2>
									<p>The next C-Class will be built on the MRA2 platform (Mercedes Rearwheel-drive Architecture), a further development of the chassis that is now used by the C-Class, E-Class and so on. Version 2.0 is said to be slightly lighter and shares some elements with EVA (Electric Vehicle Architecture), the backbone of the EQ models. The 2020 Mercedes C-Class also gets a 48V electric architecture.

										The new C-Class will continue to be marketed in sedan, T-Modell, coupe and cabrio versions. As for the engines, the Germans will continue to offer both diesel engines and petrol engines. However, Mercedes-Benz will introduce several mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions developed by the Mercedes-AMG sports division.
										
										We expect the latest turbo four-cylinder petrol engines and the clean OM 654 2.0-liter diesel that debuted in the E-Class two years ago. There will also be a series of new 3.0-liter six-cylinders-in-line engines, of which the diesel variant can already be found in the facelifted S-Class. It is expected to come to the C-class with a choice of one or two turbos, with 286 or 340 hp respectively. The three-liter petrol gets more than 400 hp. Mercedes will of course also offer a plug-in hybrid, which combines a four-cylinder petrol engine with electricity. This time, Mercedes promises the next C-Class hybrid can drive at least 100 kilometers in fully electric mode.
										
										We expect the next generation of C-Class on the road sometimes in the course of 2021.</p>
										<h3>Amg A 45 Model</h3>
										<p>The Mercedes-AMG A 45 S is the most powerful compact sports car in the world. Its 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo engine develops 421 horsepower, which is enough to top the Audi RS3 and its 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine with 400 horsepower.

											Certainly, the all-new BMW M2 CS does even better with its 3.0-liter block of 450 horsepower. But is this BMW 2 Series Coupé with an M3 engine still really compact?
											
											One thing is certain: the BMW can go and hide next to the new kit presented by the trainer Renntech. The German sorcerers have just launched on the market a set of technical modifications aimed at significantly increasing the engine power of the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S.
											
											In addition to “modest” versions which only increase power to 468 or 550 horses, Renntech proposes to increase this maximum power to 600 horses all round.
											
											</p>
									</header>
									<h2>The power of a supercar!</h2>
									<p>Yes, 600 horsepower all round is the power of a real supercar like the McLaren 600LT. We do not yet know how Renntech does it, or how such preparation can preserve the reliability of the small engine of only two liters (300 horsepower per liter, it’s huge!). There is only one picture (more of a teaser) of the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S available and Renntech will also communicate on performance and price a little later.

									</p>
									<header>
										<h4>Mercedes-AMG has released the prices of its latest hot hatches A 45 and CLA 45. The performance versions will be available in two variants, with 387 hp or 421 hp, and they set new pricing records for the compact segment. </h4>
										<p>The Mercedes-AMG A 45 S is the most powerful compact sports car in the world. Its 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo engine develops 421 horsepower, which is enough to top the Audi RS3 and its 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine with 400 horsepower.</p>
									</header>
									<p>The Germans propose two versions for each model: AMG A 45 and AMG A 45 S, respectively AMG CLA 45 and AMG CLA 45 S. The 4Matic + all-wheel drive system with Torque Control function and eight-speed automatic transmission AMG Speedshift DCT 8G are offered as standard.

										In their home market, Germany, the A 45 will set you back €56,227.50 ($62,349), while the top A 45 S costs €61,820.50 ($68,551). The four door coupe variant CLA 45 can be yours for €60,095 ($66,638). For the more powerful CLA 45 S, Mercedes-AMG asks €65,688 ($72,840).
										
										Ordering the Shooting Brake will of course demand a premium, so the starting price for the ‘base’ CLA 45 and the CLA 45 S Shooting Brake is set at €60,690 ($67,298) and €66,283 ($73,499), respectively.
										
										Regardless of the version chosen, Mercedes-AMG offers its brand new 2.0-liter turbo engine. In the case of the basic versions (A 45 and CLA 45), the engine produces 387 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 480 Nm between 4,750 and 5,000 rpm. The Mercedes-AMG A 45 S and Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S versions will receive a slightly more powerful version of the 2.0-liter engine, good for 421 horsepower at 6,750 rpm and 500 Nm between 5,000 and 5,250 rpm.
										
										The maximum speed of the basic versions is limited to 250 km / h, but it can increase up to 270 km / h by ordering the AMG Driver package. In the case of S versions, the maximum speed is limited to 270 km / h.</p>

									<p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class tuned by Wald is a Black Bison that seems to have lost the sense of style. It is not about elegance anymore and that is only normal after the luxury sedan ended up in the hands of tuning experts.

											The Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been granted the Black Bison nameplate by Wald International. The W222 generation, that entered production back in 2017, now receives a bodykit that makes it look as aggressive and mean as any sportscar. Wald International has fitted it with redesigned front and rear bumpers, with roof and boot lid wings for enhanced aerodynamics and side skirt add-ons. It now features vented front fenders, carbon fiber pillar panels and a new number plate support.

										<p>Mercedes-Benz plans to launch more hybrids within the AMG’s performance division line-up, amid a customers’ “change of mind” regarding electrification.

												The launch of plug-in hybrid powertrains was welcomed with open arms by Mercedes fleet customers, as claimed by the company’s sales director, Britta Seeger. According to Seeger, company customers as well as individuals are increasingly willing to make the transition to alternative powertrains to classic diesel and petrol engines.
												
												“In the last 12-18 months, we have noticed a change of mentality and customers have become more and more open to hybrids and electric cars. I see growth potential for AMG, both with traditional models and with electrified versions such as the future GT 4-Door Coupe Hybrid,” said Seeger.
												
												In this context, Mercedes plans to launch several hybrids within the AMG performance division. As mentioned above, the plug-in hybrid version for the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe (the four-door version of the AMG GT) is expected to enter series production by the end of 2020, and the German-prepared plug-in hybrid system will have at the base the famous 4.0-liter V8 engine.</p>
